            <h2>What is computer hardware?</h2>
            <p>Computer hardware includes the physical parts of a computer, such as the case, central processing unit (CPU), monitor, mouse, keyboard, computer data storage, 
                graphics card, sound card, speakers and motherboard.<br>
                By contrast, software is the set of instructions that can be stored and run by hardware. Hardware is so-termed because it is "hard" or rigid with respect to changes, 
                whereas software is "soft" because it is easy to change.<br>
                Hardware is typically directed by the software to execute any command or instruction. A combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing system, although other systems exist with only hardware. </p>

              <p><img src="./assets/floppy-disk-vs-hard-disk-thumbnail.png">In 1971, a group of IBM engineers led by Alan Shugart (USA) invented the floppy disk. The 20.32 cm2 
                plastic disk was nicknamed the floppy disk because of its flexibility. In 1980, Seagate introduced a competing floppy disk to IBM. By this time, the 5MB size had 
                shrunk to a 5.25-inch hard drive. It cost $4,300 (in today's dollars).

              <p><img src="./assets/FirstPC.png">IBM's own Personal Computer (IBM 5150) was introduced in August 1981, only a year after corporate executives gave the go-ahead to 
                Bill Lowe, the lab director in the company's Boca Raton, Fla., facilities. He set up a task force that developed the proposal for the first IBM PC. Early studies had 
                concluded that there were not enough applications to justify acceptance on a broad basis and the task force was fighting the idea that things couldn't be done quickly 
                in IBM.

                interface and was based on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor. Its beige case consisted of a 23 cm CRT monitor and came with a keyboard and mouse.

                fixed cage without any cooling fans.
